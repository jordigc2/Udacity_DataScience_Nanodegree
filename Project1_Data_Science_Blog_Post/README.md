- NumPy (>= 1.14.3)
- SciPy (>= 0.19.1)
- Seaborn (>= 0.8.1)

## Project Motivation  <a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in analyse and compare the two main cities of Spain using the data from Airbnb and answer the following questions:
* Are the Airbnb prices more or less expensive than the average price of a hotel in Barcelona or Madrid?
* How much will people pay during the year 2021 if they travel to Barcelona or Madrid?
* What type of accommodations are available and which are the most popular amenities?
* When is the best time to visit Barcelona and Madrid?
* Which features better describe the accommodation price?

## File Description  <a name="files"></a>
These datasets consist of three CSV files:
* Listings file: This file includes how many rooms, beds and bathrooms has, which amenities are included, how many accommodates can be in that property, the property type, the room type, the price of the property, the coordinates where is located, the district where is located and some more.
* Calendar file: This file includes each property during 2021 if is available or not and with the price of the day.
* Reviews file: This file includes the user's opinion of the property. This file is not used in this project.

The datasets are obtained from [Insideairbnb Madrid](http://insideairbnb.com/madrid/) and [Insideairbnb Barcelona](http://insideairbnb.com/barcelona/)
